# image classification

PROJECT STILL IN PROGRESS

This program is created as a way to introduce myself to the machine learning technique of image classification. I used a dataset ("Stanford Dogs Dataset") that contains hundreds of pictures of different dog breeds. I handpicked a few different breeds and developed a model that can identify these breeds.

# Problem Statement
I wanted to learn more about image classification because I strongly believe in its usability. So, I am working on a simple model to introduce myself. Once I learn how to develop image classification models, I plan on implementing a solution to related major issues. Recently, a close friend of mine was involved in a car wreck wherein the other driver was distracted by his phone. This issue of distracted driving reinforces the idea that we need a way to determine if a driver is acting irresponsibly at the time. I believe that it can be possible to create an image classification model that can distinguish distracted and focused drivers by their posture. This is the current major issue I'm pursuing a solution for.

# Current model updates
My current model for my dog breed image classification model is named "Modeling-Copy1.ipynb". The estimated accuracy at this time is between 30-40%. I am working on improving this accuracy. Some issues that may be causing the accuracy to be this low can be: too little of data, too little training (epochs), and overfitting/underfitting. I will be checking each of these possibilities and finding a way to make it more accurate.
